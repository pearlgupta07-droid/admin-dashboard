# Exp-1: Admin Dashboard with CSS Grid and Theme Switching

## Title
Develop an admin dashboard with CSS Grid layout and dynamic theme switching.

## Description
This experiment implements a static admin dashboard using HTML, CSS Grid, and vanilla JavaScript. The layout uses CSS Grid for the overall page shell and nested grids for cards and widgets. A dynamic theme switcher toggles between light and dark modes using CSS custom properties (variables) and a single data-theme attribute on the root element. [web:11][web:16]

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand how to design a complete page layout using **CSS** Grid (header, sidebar, main content, footer).
- Use nested grids to organize dashboard cards, widgets, and responsive sections.
- Apply CSS custom properties to define theme-specific colors and reuse them across the layout. [web:16]
- Implement a light/dark theme switcher in JavaScript by toggling a `data-theme` attribute.
- Persist user theme preference using `localStorage` and respect system `prefers-color-scheme`. [web:20]

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (CSS Grid, flexbox, CSS variables)
- JavaScript (ES6, DOM API, localStorage)
